# WhatsApp Group Chat Analysis using NLP

This project aims to perform analysis on WhatsApp group chat data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project utilizes Python programming language and various libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, and scikit-learn for text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: The project preprocesses the raw WhatsApp chat data to remove noise, including special characters, emojis, and URLs.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Sentiment analysis is performed to determine the overall sentiment of the messages in the chat, including positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
- **Topic Modeling**: Topic modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are employed to identify key topics discussed in the chat.
- **Visualization**: The project provides visualization tools to represent the results of sentiment analysis and topic modeling using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NLTK
- spaCy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn


## Usage

1. Export your WhatsApp group chat data in text format.
2. Place the exported chat file in the `data` directory.
3. Run the main script:
4. Follow the prompts to select the analysis type (sentiment analysis or topic modeling) and specify other parameters.
5. The results will be displayed in the console and saved as visualizations in the `output` directory.
